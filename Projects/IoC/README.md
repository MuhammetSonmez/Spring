## IoC
This project has been developed in Java, utilizing the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle and adhering to design patterns, to enable the usage of Oracle, SQL Server, and MS SQL databases without spaghetti code.

The project contains a database operations library that reduces dependencies and adopts a modular structure by employing the IoC principle. The database operations are designed to be compatible with various database systems like Oracle, SQL Server, and MS SQL.

The project is built upon the IoC feature of the Spring Framework. Therefore, it is recommended to use Spring to manage IoC and database connections. Alongside Spring, the project provides appropriate database connection configurations based on the type of database to be used in the application.
